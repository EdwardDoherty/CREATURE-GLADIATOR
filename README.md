# This is Creature Gladiator
A game I built as I was re-discovering computer programming. 
I began programming when I was in elementary school. I discovered batch files and would make all sorts of text-based games.
I coded all throughout school, but stopped coding as much after high school as my time became more limited with work.
I got back into programming after trying to build a bills program using Excel (which has now become my Money Management System, see repo).
When I first got back into Python, I figured I'd make an homage to all of those text based fantasy RPGs I made way back then.
I'm sure I could improve a lot about this game, and I'd love to make it into a 2D game someday, in the style of a Pokemon Battle perhaps, but for now, here's Creature Gladiator!

# How to Play:
Unfortunately, since this is written in Python, you will have to install Python on your computer, and then run the "Creature Gladiatorv2.py" file using that. Someday, maybe I'll write this in Javascript so you can play it in a web browser.
